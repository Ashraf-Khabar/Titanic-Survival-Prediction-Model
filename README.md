Titanic Survival Prediction Model
=================================

This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic based on various parameters such as age, gender, class, and fare.

Requirements
------------

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python 3 installed along with the following libraries:

-   NumPy
-   Pandas
-   Matplotlib
-   Seaborn
-   Scikit-Learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

Copy code

`pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`

Usage
-----

To use the model, simply clone this repository and run the `titanic.py` file:

Copy code

`python titanic.py`

This will train the model on the Titanic dataset and evaluate its performance using cross-validation. The output will show the model's accuracy score and a confusion matrix.

You can also modify the code to use your own dataset or to experiment with different machine learning algorithms and parameters.
